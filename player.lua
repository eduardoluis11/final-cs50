--[[ BEGINNING OF COMMENT
	This script will have the code for the main character. It starts with an uppercase letter since it’s a class, and classes are 
    written beginning with capital letters.
	
    I will use class.lua to make a class in Lua, and I will create the playable character’s properties by creating a class. To do this, 
    
    I will use a good portion of the code shown from Colton’s 2018 Game Dev class which can be found here: 
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IdOCxHGMIo&t=2006s .

-- This creates the class that will create the main character
Player = Class{}

-- Initializing function, which will contain many of the properties of the main character’s class.
function Player:init()
	self.image = love.graphics.newImage('graphics/player.png')

	-- This automatically obtains the width of the player’s sprite
	self.width = self.image:getWidth()
	self.height = self.image:getHeight()

	--[[ X and y coordinates of the player. Initially, I will put him on the (100, 100) coordinates.  --]]
	self.x = 100
	self.y = 100
end

-- This will render the player’s sprite onscreen
function Player:render()
	love.graphics.draw(self.image, self.x, self.y)
end
